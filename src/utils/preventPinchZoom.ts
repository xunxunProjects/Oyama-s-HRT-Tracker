// Pinch-to-zoom is a browser affordance for pages that don't fit the screen.
// This one does, so on an installed PWA the gesture only ever scales the app
// out of its own window — and the way back is another pinch the user has to
// think about. index.html asks for that with `user-scalable=no` and index.css
// with `touch-action`, which is all Blink and Gecko need on touchscreens.
// Safari honours neither for page zoom: it only stops when the non-standard,
// WebKit-only gesture events are cancelled, which is what this file is for.

/**
 * Stop a two-finger pinch from zooming the page.
 *
 * Components with their own pinch handling keep working. `preventDefault`
 * cancels the browser's zoom; it does not stop the event reaching listeners a
 * component registered on its own subtree, and those run before this one does.

    // which is what keeps this from taking zoom away outright.

    // WebKit hold every trackpad scroll until this script has answered, which
