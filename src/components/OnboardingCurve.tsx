 * land on a timeline, a curve accumulates through them, then two lab results
 * arrive *below* that curve and the whole line comes down to meet them. The
 * third beat is the one worth the code — showing the model being wrong is the
 * only honest way to say what calibration is for, and it is the one thing the
 * step's prose can assert but not demonstrate.
 *
 * Every number plotted comes from `runSimulation` and `computeCalibration`,
 * the functions the Overview itself runs. Nothing here is a drawn squiggle
 * with plausible-looking bumps: if the engine's answer changes, this picture
 * changes with it, and a curve that could drift away from the product without
 * anyone noticing would be worse than no curve at all.
