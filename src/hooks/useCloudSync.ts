/**
 * Automatic two-way cloud sync.
 *
 * What this replaces: an upload-only auto-backup, plus a startup check that
 * noticed local and cloud had diverged and asked the user to sort it out. The
 * check could only ever offer "add what the cloud has and this device doesn't",
 * so an edit or a deletion left the two sides diverged and the prompt came back
 * on the next launch, and the next.
 *
 * Here the app reconciles the two sides itself (see utils/syncMerge) and says
 * nothing unless something goes wrong.
 *
 * Two paths run against the cloud:
 *
 *   - **Full sync** — fetch the newest backup, merge it with local, apply the
 *     result here, upload it if the cloud copy is behind. Runs on sign-in, when
 *     the tab is brought back to the foreground, when the network returns, and
 *     on a slow timer while visible.
 *   - **Push** — upload local after a change, debounced. Fetches only the
 *     backup list, not a body, so logging a dose doesn't cost a full download.
 *
 * Nothing writes over a revision it hasn't read. Storage gives no help here:
 * every save inserts a new newest revision, with no "only if unchanged", so a
 * device that uploads without looking silently replaces whatever another one
 * wrote. Records survive that — the next merge unions them back — but deletions
 * do not, because the tombstone goes with the revision that was overwritten and
 * the record returns. So the push path first checks the newest revision is
 * still the one it reconciled with, and hands off to a full sync when it isn't.
 *
 * Three more things keep this from hammering the endpoint, which keeps five
 * revisions per account and rate-limits to twenty writes a minute: a push is
 * skipped when the payload's content fingerprint matches what was last
 * uploaded; a sync in flight absorbs any trigger that arrives while it runs;
 * and foreground/poll syncs are floored at one a minute.
